# Crypto-articles-webscraping

In this project, articles about new technology, and especially cryptocurrency are scraped from different websites. Then these articles are analyzed to find the polarity score, which presents the negativity/positivity of the articles. 

It includes 2 programs:
- Web-scraping : scrape articles from news websites
- Sentiments-analysis: Use Vader algorithm to find polarity score

An [example](NewsSentiment.xlsx) of the output of the programs: Most 5 positive and 5 negative articles in a day.
